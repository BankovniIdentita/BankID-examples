# Czech BankID examples

This project is devoted to code examples for integration on 
the [Czech Banking Identity](https://www.bankid.cz) solution (Czech BankID). 
Samples can be tested directly against the Sandbox, which is available 
through the BankID [Developer Portal](https://developer.bankid.cz).

Banking identity services make it easy to integrate authentication using 
the banks' identities involved in the project into the Service Provider's 
applications. The end-user can thus perform authentication using the 
same authentication means to access his bank's banking services.

> With a simple implementation based on the OpenID Connect framework, 
> the developer has the opportunity to get 5 million clients of Czech 
> banks into their application.

We will gradually add examples in various programming languages to this 
repository.

**Available examples:**
- [Java](JAVAEXAMPLES.md) ( discovery, authentication, token exchange, and data transfer)
